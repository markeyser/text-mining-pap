## Session Calendar

- [ ] Session 1: 09/24 (Tuesday)
- [ ] Session 2: 10/01 (Tuesday)
- [ ] Session 3: 10/08 (Tuesday)

All sessions in the evening 1:30-4:00 pm.

## What will you take home?

- Good understanding about the Data Science profession
- Overview of all main NLP problems
- Getting familiar with the most popular Python analytical libraries: Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn, Spacy or NLTK.

## Teaching style

Each seassion includes:

    - Theory
    - Tutorials 

## Python programming

In this course we are going to use:

- Python 3.7 installation
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Spacy
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebooks / Lab

If you don't have the above installation, you can get it following the next section.

Any other Python 3 installation will also do the trick.

## Data Competition Websites

Throughout the course, we will be using datasets publicly available in Kaggle so you will need to set up a Kaggle account which is totally free and will allow you to access to all data sets and competitions available in Kaggle to try your newly acquired skills.
