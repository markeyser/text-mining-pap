In the real world, specifically for text data, you're not going to have a convenient label attached to a text dataset such as positive or negative or spam versus ham. Instead, you may have a variety of labels such as the different categories a newspaper article could be in and you may just have the text itself unlabelled. So it's up to us to try to discover those labels through topic modeling."
