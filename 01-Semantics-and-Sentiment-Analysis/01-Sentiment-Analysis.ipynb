    "While the scope of sentiment analysis is very broad, we will focus our work in two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Polarity classification\n",
    "We won't try to determine if a sentence is objective or subjective, fact or opinion. Rather, we care only if the text expresses a *positive*, *negative* or *neutral* opinion.\n",
    "### 2. Document level scope\n",
    "We'll also try to aggregate all of the sentences in a document or paragraph, to arrive at an overall opinion.\n",
    "### 3. Coarse analysis\n",
    "We won't try to perform a fine-grained analysis that would determine the degree of positivity/negativity. That is, we're not trying to guess how many stars a reviewer awarded, just whether the review was positive or negative."

    "* First, consider the text being analyzed. A model trained on paragraph-long movie reviews might not be effective on tweets. Make sure to use an appropriate model for the task at hand.\n",
    "* Next, decide the type of analysis to perform. In the previous section on text classification we used a bag-of-words technique that considered only single tokens, or *unigrams*. Some rudimentary sentiment analysis models go one step further, and consider two-word combinations, or *bigrams*. In this section, we'd like to work with complete sentences, and for this we're going to import a trained NLTK lexicon called *VADER*."
