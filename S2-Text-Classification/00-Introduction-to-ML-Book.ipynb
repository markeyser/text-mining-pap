    "So for example if we're discussing linear regression you'll get a reading assignment to read chapter 3 of this book. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you do want to do the reading I would recommend that you read chapters 1 and 2 right now to gain a background understanding before continuing the rest of the machine learning lectures."

    "- For example, a piece of equipment could have dta points labeled either \"F\" (failed) or \"R\" (runs).\n",
    "- The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.\n",
    "- It then modifies the model accordingly.\n",
    "- Through methods like **classification** and **regression**, supervised learning uses patterns to predict the values of the label on additional unlabeled data.\n",
